He was a member of the Lier municipal council for the Conservative Municipal Group from 2003 until his death, and served in the areas of health, culture, childhood, education.[18] In 2003, he was one of the top five candidates to run for mayor.[19]  Notable works[edit] According to the Web of Science, Sagvolden published over 103 articles in peer-reviewed scientific journals. As of January 2014[update], these articles have been cited over 3400 times, resulting in an h-index of 30. His three most-cited publications (> 185 times) are:  Sagvolden T, Johansen EB, Aase H, Russell VA (June 2005).
