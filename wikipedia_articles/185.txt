    From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia     This is a complete list of members of the United States Senate during the 85th United States Congress listed by seniority, from January 3, 1957, to January 3, 1959. Order of service is based on the commencement of the senator's first term. Behind this is former service as a senator (only giving the senator seniority within his or her new incoming class), service as vice president, a House member, a cabinet secretary, or a governor of a state. The final factor is the population of the senator's state.[1][2][3][4] In this congress, J. William Fulbright (D-Arkansas) was the most senior junior senator and John Sherman Cooper (R-Kentucky) was the most junior senior senator. Senators who were sworn in during the middle of the two-year congressional term (up until the last senator who was not sworn in early after winning the November 1958 election) are listed at the end of the list with no number.
