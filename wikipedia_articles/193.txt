Mango is an American biologist, the former H.A. and Edna Benning Professor of Oncological Sciences at the University of Utah,[1] and former professor at Harvard University.[2] She is Professor of Cell and Developmental Biology and research group leader at Biozentrum University of Basel[3] Mango graduated from Harvard University, and from Princeton University with a Ph.D. She was a postdoctoral research fellow in the lab of Judith Kimble at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. She and her team are currently studying the cells of the worm C. elegans to observe how a cell transforms from a pluripotent state into a particular cell type.[4] Her articles have been published in Nature,[5] Science,[6] Cell,[7] and PLoS Biology.[8]  Awards[edit] 2008 MacArthur Fellows Program[9] 2019 Elected member of the European Molecular Biology Organization (EMBO)[10] References[edit]   ^ "Faculty - Molecular Biology Program - Bioscience Graduate Studies - the University of Utah".
