The surprise is not so much by the quality of the writing, as Cables’ credentials are unassailable, but by the freshness, appeal and promise heard in this new collaboration with singer and lyricist Sarah Elizabeth Charles. In Charles, Cables has found a musical soulmate who is profoundly attuned to his repertoire and playing".[3]  Track listing[edit] All compositions by George Cables except where noted  "Traveling Lady" – 6:22 "AKA Reggie" – 7:26 "The Dark the Light" (lyrics by Sarah Elizabeth Charles) – 6:49 "For Honey Lulu" (lyrics by Charles) – 5:49 "Melodious Funk" – 6:27 "Face the Consequences" (lyrics by Charles) – 5:20 "Colors of Light" (lyrics by Charles) – 8:42 "Think on Me" (lyrics by Janice Jarrett) – 5:55 "The Mystery of Monifa Brown" – 7:55 "Baby Steps" – 6:19 "Suite for Sweet Rita" (lyrics by Charles) – 5:43 Personnel[edit] George Cables – piano Essiet Essiet – bass Victor Lewis – drums Sarah Elizabeth Charles – vocals (tracks 3, 4, 6–8 & 11) Craig Handy – saxophones, flute (tracks 3, 4, 6 & 8) Steve Kroon – percussion (tracks 3, 4 & 8) References[edit]   ^ Jazz Depot: HighNote discography accessed February 26, 2019  ^ George Cables website: album details accessed February 26, 2019  ^ Joyce, M.
