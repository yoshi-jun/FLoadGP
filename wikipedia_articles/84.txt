It is part of Colares civil parish. Azenhas do Mar means Watermills of the Sea and the name derives from a once-powerful stream that moved the watermills as it made its way to the sea.[1] It is located just 30 km (19 mi) away from Lisbon, near Cabo da Roca, Palácio da Pena (Pena Palace), and other attractions.[2] The place is a Mediterranean-looking village with white houses tumbling down to the Atlantic. In the mid-20th century, wealthy families from Lisbon and Sintra decided that the location was perfect for summer homes, which can be seen outside the main cluster of houses that originally were a fishing community's homes.[1] There are several popular beaches located near the Azenhas do Mar, namely Praia da Aguda, Praia do Magoito (mostly frequented by locals and surfers), and Praia das Maçãs.[1] Near Praia das Maçãs there is a Prehistoric Monument, also known as the Tholos of Outeiro das Mós, consists of an artificial Neolithic cave and a Chalcolithic domed or beehive tomb.
