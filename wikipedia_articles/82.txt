    From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia   American racing driver (born 1961) Stan Wattles (born July 24, 1961 in Glen Cove, New York) is a former driver in the Indy Racing League.  He raced in the 1996–2001 seasons with 19 career starts, including the Indianapolis 500 in 1998–2000.  He placed 8th in two races, and led his 2 laps in his first, in 1996 at Walt Disney World Speedway, but never led in his other contests. In the 1999 VisionAire 500K at Lowe's Motor Speedway, Wattles was involved in a crash that killed three spectators when debris from his car cleared the fence, and 18 laps later, the race was cancelled.[1]   Racing record[edit] SCCA National Championship Runoffs[edit]   Year Track Car Engine Class Finish Start Status   1988 Road Atlanta Swift DB4 Toyota Formula Atlantic 3 3 Running   1994 Mid-Ohio Ralt RT40 Toyota Formula Atlantic 1 1 Running  American Open Wheel[edit] (key)  IndyCar[edit]   Year  Team  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  Rank  Points  Ref   1996  Leigh Miller Racing  WDW13  PHXWth  INDY                      25th  44  [2]   1996-97  McCormack Motorsports  NHM16  LVS18  WDW  PHX  INDY  TXS  PPIR  CLT  NH2          31st  63  [3]   Metro Racing Systems                    LV28         1998  Metro Racing Systems  WDW22  PHXDNQ  INDY28  TXS10  NHM17  DOV  CLT  PPIRWth  ATL26  TX28  LVS13      25th  88  [4]   1999  Metro Racing  WDW24  PHX  CLTC  INDY17  TXS  PPIR  ATL  DOV  PPI2  LVS  TX2      35th  19  [5]   2000  Hemelgarn Racing  WDW  PHX  LVS  INDY23  TXS  PPIR  ATL  KTY  TX2          43rd  7  [6]   2001  Hemelgarn Racing  PHX16  HMS26  ATL12  INDYDNQ  TXS  PPI  RIR  KAN  NSH  KTY  STL  CHI  TX2  32nd  36  [7]  Indy 500 results[edit]   Year  Chassis  Engine  Start  Finish   1998  Riley & Scott  Oldsmobile  29th  28th   1999  Dallara  Oldsmobile  20th  17th   2000  Dallara  Oldsmobile  8th  23rd   2001  Dallara  Oldsmobile  Qualifying Crash  References[edit]   ^ "Tragedy at the track".
