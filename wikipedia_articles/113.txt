During this time, Hazarajat was more peaceful than other parts of Afghanistan.[1] This was the most organized and successful Hazara uprising after several failed uprisings in the 20th century, providing the Hazaras with an organized government for the first time.[3][4]  Aftermath[edit] Following the uprising, the Shura-e-ittifaqi established an Islamic government controlling the majority of Hazarajat.[1][3] The Kabul government attempted to undermine the new government in Hazarajat by using techniques such as divide and rule, and manipulating ethnic and tribal disputes but these failed.[1]  See also[edit] Sayyid Ali Beheshti Islamic Republic Of Hazarajat References[edit]   ^ a b c d Sarabi, Humayun (2006).
