Family[edit] Barroso was the daughter of military Alfredo José Barroso (Alvor, 15 April 1887 - Campo Grande, Lisbon, 14 January 1970) and Maria da Encarnação Simões, born in Coimbra, they married in Alvor in 1912. She's the paternal granddaughter of José Barroso de Sousa and his wife Maria de Jesus Barroso and the maternal granddaughter of Manuel dos Santos and his wife Maria da Rainha Santa. She was the paternal aunt of Alfredo Barroso and the maternal aunt of Mário Barroso, Eduardo Barroso and Graça Barroso.  Biography[edit] She came from a big family - she was the fifth of seven siblings - Maria de Jesus Barroso was there for the family's move, from Fuseta to Setúbal and, then, from Setúbal to Lisbon. Her father, an opposer to the dictatorship, was arrested in the Lisbon Penitentiary and was deported to the Azores, where he was jailed in the Angra do Heroísmo Fort. After her primary education, that she did in Setúbal and Lisbon, she attended the secondary schools of D. Filipa de Lencastre and Pedro Nunes. In her adolescence she gained an interest for theater and the art of spoken poetry, what led her to attend the Course of Dramatic Art in the National Conservatory Theater School. She ended her studies in 1943. She was a director and teacher of Art of Saying in the Colégio Moderno, replacing Manuel Lereno.[3] Through the actor Assis Pacheco she enters the prestigious theater company Rey Colaço-Robles Monteiro, based in the D. Maria II National Theatre, replacing Maria Lalande. She debuted in 1944 in Aparências (Appearances), of Jacinto Benavente, directed by Palmira Bastos, and had prominent interpretation in Benilde ou a Virgem Mãe (Benilde or the Virgin Mother) of José Régio.[4] Circa 1946, after acting in Coimbra A Casa da Bernarda Alba (The House of Bernarda Alba), of Federico García Lorca, she's prevented from remaining in that company by interference of PIDE. While being an actress, Barroso continued her studies in the Faculty of Arts, Lisbon, where she would obtain a degree in Historical and Philosophical Sciences, in 1951. It was in college that she met Mário Soares, whom she would marry on 22 February 1949, by proxy (but registered at the 3rd Conservatory of the Civil Register of Lisbon).[5] Soares was then jailed for political reasons. With Soares, Barroso had two children, politician João Soares, born 1949, and psychologist Isabel Barroso Soares, born 1951, who manages the Colégio Moderno in Lisbon.[6] After being stopped from working in theater, Barroso would also be forbidden by the government to be a teacher. She applied for an internship for admission to teach, not having been accepted in a public school, choosing to do an internship in Colégio Moderno, ran by her father-in-law João Soares. After two years, however, her license to teach in private schools would be revoked by the National Education  Ministry. She would manage the family school and only after the Carnation Revolution would she, legally, act as its director. She would return to acting, in Antígona (1965) in the Villaret Theater,[7] and in cinema, with the emergency of the Cinema Novo Português, acting in Paulo Soares da Rocha's movie, Mudar de Vida (To Change Life),[4] debuting in 1966. In the 70s and 80s she acted in Manoel de Oliveira's movies (1985 - Le Soulier de Satin, 1979 - Amor de Perdição, 1975 - Benilde ou a Virgem Mãe). In 1968, Barroso accompanies her husband when he is deported to São Tomé, where she is again prevented from teaching. Later, in the 70s, when the Marcello Caetano government allows Soares to exile in Paris, Barroso returns to Portugal, continuing to manage the family school. In 1969, Barroso ran as a deputy for the CEUD (Electoral Commission of Democratic Unity), led by Mário Soares, and where Catholics and monarchists involved in the democratic opposition to the regime would insert themselves. In 1973, she participated in the III Congress of Democratic Oopposition, in Aveiro, being the only women to intervene in the opening session. She was one of the seven people to vote against the transformation of the Portuguese Socialist  Action, against the official stand of Mário Soares.[8]  Mário Soares and Maria Barroso in Porto's Bishop's funeral, D.

Although not as politically involved as her husband, Maria Barroso was a founding member of the Socialist Party in Bad Münstereifel, Germany in 1973. In 1986, Soares is elected President of the Republic and Barroso takes on the role of First Lady of Portugal (1986- 1996). As the First Lady, her intervention was directed towards the defense of the family sense and fighting against social exclusion and all forms of violence, participating in numerous initiatives in Portugal and other Portuguese speaking countries. In 1990, she created the Mozambique Emergency movement, granting, in the following year, the scripture of the Association for the Study and Prevention of Violence. In 1995, she presided over the opening of the cycle of realizations for the International Year of Fighting against racism, xenophobia, antisemitism and social exclusion. After leaving the Belém Palace, in 1997, she became the president of the Portuguese Red Cross, position she held until 2003. She was also a founding partner and president of the Administration Council of ONGD, since 1994 until her death, and also presided over the Aristides Sousa Mendes Foundation. She was awarded a Honoris Causa doctorate by the Lesley University[9] (23 May 1994), by the University of Aveiro (16 December 1996),[10] by the University of Lisbon (3 November 1999) and by the Universidade Lusófona in 2012.

She was transported to the hospital by her nephew Eduardo Barroso, a well-known hepato-biliary surgeon, walking in by her own foot. An initial CT scan revealed nothing serious; however, her condition worsened during the subsequent hours, and new exams revealed an extensive intracranial hemorrhage.
