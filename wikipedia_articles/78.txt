Service[edit] The 52nd New York was formed on October 29, 1861 when two different units recruiting in New York City, New York were consolidated.  The German Rangers, under Emil Von Schoening, had been enlisting men since the start of August 1861 while the Sigle Rifles, under Paul Frank, has been doing the same since the beginning of October 1861.  Both units were composed mostly of German immigrants.  Companies A-G came from the German Rangers while Companies H, I and K came from the Sigel Rifles.  Paul Frank was appointed Colonel of the 52nd.  The regiment was mustered in on November 1, 1861 for three years service.   In July 1862 a number of men from the 52nd were attached to the 1st New York Light Artillery Battalion, a four battery battalion also composed of ethnic Germans.  In May 1863 this battalion was broken up, with the batteries renamed the 29th, 30th, 31st and 32nd Independent Battery’s.  Those men returned to the 52nd in June 1863. On April 23, 1863, 46 enlisted men of the 7th New York Infantry Regiment were temporarily transferred to the 52nd.  The 7th, the only other New York regiment in the 2nd Corps composed of Germans, was to be mustered out as the regiment enlisted for only two years.  These 46 men were recruited in 1862 and had less than one year of service.  Colonel George Von Schack of the 7th was hoping to reorganize his regiment for further service, so these men were attached to the 52nd as a separate group until the 7th could return.  However, the 7th was unable to reform in 1863 and those members were fully absorbed into the 52nd after Gettysburg.  The 7th finally did return in 1864, as the 7th New York Veteran Infantry Regiment, and four of the companies were attached to the 52nd as they mustered in between March and July.  On July 22, 1864 the 7th New York Veterans began to act as an independent unit, and the surviving members of the 7th New York were transferred into it. By the second week of October 1863, the 52nd received about 600 newly enlisted men.  Many of them had been drafted over the summer or enlisted as substitutes.  These new men came from all over New York, and included both immigrants and those born in the United States.  Many of them did not have German ancestry.  In December 1863, a number of original members of the regiment re-enlisted for another three years. From August to the end of October, 1864, those soldiers who enlisted in 1861 and had not re-enlisted the prior year were mustered out when their term of service expired.  During that time, men were transferred between companies, with Companies A-D eventually mustering out.  At the end of October, Companies E, F, G, H, I, and K were renamed Companies A-F, with a new Company G composed of new recruits.   The 52nd New York Infantry mustered out on July 1, 1865 at Alexandria, Virginia.
