The Legislative Assembly proposed to immediately deal with Crick, however the Speaker ruled that the Assembly could not deal with the matter as it might prejudice his criminal trial. Instead the assembly amended its standing orders and suspended Crick pending the outcome of his criminal trial.[3] The jury was unable to reach a unanimous verdict,[4] and the Attorney General declined to prosecute the matter again as evidence before the Royal Commission had been ruled inadmissible in his criminal trial.[3] Crick then submitted his resignation from parliament, however before it was accepted the assembly passed a motion that he was guilty of conduct that rendered him ineligible to sit as a member.[1] Rutledge and Nairn stated this was due to old scores being paid off,[1] while Anne Twomey stated that this motion was passed to influence future voters not to vote for Crick.[3] In any event Crick did not nominate for the by-election.

He died the following year.[1]  See also[edit] Electoral results for the district of Blayney List of New South Wales state by-elections   References[edit]   ^ a b c d e f g Rutledge, Martha & Nairn, Bede.
