The summit is around 2.5 kilometres (1.6 mi) south of Longformacus and 9 kilometres (5.6 mi) west of Duns. It is an isolated hill to the south of the Lammermuir Plateau. Dirrington Little Law (360 metres (1,180 ft)) is located 2 kilometres (1.2 mi) to the south-west. Geologically, the two Dirrington Laws comprise Carboniferous volcanic felsite (riebeckite), and may be the remains of a laccolith, a type of volcanic intrusion into the surrounding sedimentary rocks of the Old Red Sandstone.[1] At the summit of Dirrington Great Law are three large circular cairns, 23.5 metres (77 ft), 21 metres (69 ft), and 8.5 metres (28 ft) in diameter.[2] The cairns are composed of stones excavated from the hilltop, rather than from loose stone gathered from the ground.[3]  See also[edit] List of places in the Scottish Borders References[edit]   ^ Irving, John (1930).
