Saying, the previous album was focused on featuring drummer Masayuki Suzuki, but that Eve to Dawn would be guitar driven.[3] Singer Minoru Niihara said that the lyrics has a more positive vibe than in previous releases because of the impact of the Great East Japan earthquake and the instrumental "A Light in the Dark" was dedicated by Takasaki to that tragic event.[4] Regarding the album title "Eve to Dawn", 'Eve' was added because Loudness celebrated the 30th anniversary of their debut album The Birthday Eve and because the late Munetaka Higuchi's birthday was on Christmas Eve, 'Dawn' has the double meaning of a new start towards the world, as well as the rising sun of Japan.[4]  Track listing[edit] All lyrics by Minoru Niihara, English lyrics co-written by Takashi Kanazawa.
