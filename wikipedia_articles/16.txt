It is situated downstream of the confluence of the Jhelum and Chenab rivers. It is situated some 25 kilometres (16 mi) from the city of Jhang[1][2] near the city of Athara Hazari where the River Jhelum flows into the River Chenab. It was one of the 7 link canals to be built under the Indus Water Plan of Pakistan. Pakistan created this plan after concluding the Indus Water Treaty with India. Trimmu Barrage is used to control water flow into the River Chenab for irrigation and flood control. Trimmu Barrage is a vital flood control and irrigation structure located on the Chenab River near the city of Jhang, Pakistan. Constructed between 1938 and 1939 by British engineers, the barrage was designed primarily to safeguard Jhang and its surrounding areas from seasonal flooding, which had historically posed significant risks to lives and livelihoods. The project was spearheaded by Chief Engineer James Douglas Hardy Bedford. The architectural design of Trimmu Barrage integrates an arched grid-iron bridge supported by a network of protective bands, showcasing engineering techniques of the early 20th century. Over time, the barrage has been the subject of extensive modernization efforts aimed at bolstering its operational efficiency and structural resilience. Key upgrades have included the construction of new gates, maintenance of the original structures, and the reconstruction of bridges to improve functionality and durability. During a major rehabilitation phase concluding on June 30, 2020, temporary traffic restrictions were implemented to ensure safety and facilitate uninterrupted construction activities. Light Transport Vehicles (LTVs) were allowed access during specific hours, whereas Heavy Transport Vehicles (HTVs) were entirely restricted until the completion of the works. Following the upgrades, both LTVs and HTVs were permitted to cross the barrage, reflecting the project's successful adaptation to contemporary transportation needs. The restored and modernized Trimmu Barrage now stands as a critical infrastructure asset, combining enhanced flood management capabilities with improved connectivity across the Chenab River. Its role extends beyond flood control, contributing significantly to regional irrigation systems and supporting local economies dependent on agriculture and trade. The barrage remains a testament to the ingenuity of its original designers and the ongoing commitment to its preservation and functionality.
