(September 2021)  Cowboy culture is the set of behaviors, preferences, and appearances associated with (or resulting from the influence of) the attitudes, ethics, and history of the American cowboy.[1] The term can describe the content or stylistic appearance of an artistic representation, often built on romanticized impressions of the wild west, or certain aspects of people's lifestyle, such as their choices in recreation (including enjoyment of Western movies and music), apparel, and western or southwestern cuisine.  A portrayal of one popular aspect of cowboy culture in The Herd Quitter by C. M. Russell  Origins[edit] The origins of cowboy culture go back to the Spanish vaqueros who settled in New Mexico and later Texas bringing cattle.[2] By the late 1800s, one in three cowboys were Mexican and brought to the lifestyle its iconic symbols of hats, bandanas, spurs, stirrups, lariat, and lasso.[3] With westward movement brought many distinct ethnicities all with their own cultural traditions. Welsh Americans, as one example, had a history in Wales of cattle and sheep droving, that incorporated well into ranch work.[4]Welsh Drovers Mythologizing[edit] In the late 19th century, folk tales about cowboys and attempts to commercialize on cowboy life by selling exaggerated ideas of it in novels and fashion became popular.[5]  Dime novels[edit] Main article: Western comics Beginning in the 1860s, dime novels began sharing erroneous and highly romanticized tales of the West, feeding the public's interest in the trade and life West of the Mississippi.[6]  Radio, film and television[edit] Main articles: Western (genre) and Westerns on television Throughout the 20th century, radio, film and television had a profound effect on the fashion and mannerisms that built the foundation of what it meant to be living a western lifestyle, however most of this was more Hollywood glitz and glamour than historical narrative.[7] Display of Gene Autry memorabilia Revival[edit] In the 1980s, following the urbanization of much of the Texas population, there was a marked revival of cowboy culture with the creation of a number of organizations devoted to its preservation, among them the American Cowboy Culture Association.[8]  Notable people[edit] The following is a list of notable people who lived or are living a western lifestyle post to its technological and societal change at the beginning of the 20th century. This list does not include those of whom lived during the 19th century who were living in what was considered the Old West and preoccupied with the western norms of the day.
