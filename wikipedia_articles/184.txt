At Brown, Kuritzkes studied with playwrights Gregory Moss, Lisa D'Amour, and Erik Ehn, participated in Production Workshop,[8] and was involved in local protests affiliated with the Occupy movement.[5][9] Kuritzkes graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in 2012.[10]  Career[edit] Kuritzkes's one-act play An Autobiography of my Brother, first written for the 2008 Harvard-Westlake Playwrights Festival, was among the works honored at the 2010 Young Playwrights Competition.[7] Beginning during his time at Brown University, Kuritzkes uploaded videos recorded using the Photo Booth application to YouTube.[1] The most famous of these videos, "Potion Seller", went viral online and inspired parodies in publications including The New Yorker.[11] Kuritzkes received a MacDowell Fellowship in both 2012 and 2016.[5] In 2016, his play The Sensuality Party toured the university circuit of New York state.[12][13]  He released the novel Famous People in 2019.[14][15] In 2021, Kuritzkes's spec script Challengers was featured on the annual edition of The Black List, which was then adapted into a feature film directed by Luca Guadagnino.[16] Ahead of the film's release, he was named one of the top 10 screenwriters to watch in 2023 by Variety.[17]  He also adapted William S. Burroughs' 1985 novel Queer for a film directed by Guadagnino.[18] In April 2024, Variety reported that Kuritzkes would write the screen adaptation of the Don Winslow novel City on Fire, set to star Austin Butler.[19] In June 2024 he was announced to be developing an untitled film with Jude Law, reportedly inspired by the works of Mike Nichols.[20] In November 2024, it was announced he had penned a feature film based on the DC character Sgt. Rock, which would reunite him with Queer collaborators Luca Guadagnino and Daniel Craig.[21]  Personal life[edit] Kuritzkes has been married to filmmaker Celine Song since June 11, 2016.
