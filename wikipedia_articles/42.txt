The mayor can veto proposed bills, but the council can override it with a two-thirds supermajority. The council usually meets at the Session Hall of the Sangguniang Panlungsod Building along Padre Jose A. Ramon Street at Estaka for regular sessions. As of 2023, the Sangguniang Panlungsod Building is undergoing redevelopment, and the council temporarily meets and holds offices at the Function Room of the Boulevard Commercial Complex at the Dipolog Boulevard.[1]   Powers, duties and functions[edit] The Sangguniang Panlungsod, as the legislative body of the city, is mandated by the Local Government Code of 1991 (Republic Act No. 7160) to:  Enact ordinances; Approve resolutions; Appropriate funds for the general welfare of the city and its inhabitants; and Ensure the proper exercise of the corporate powers of the city as provided for under Section 22 of the Local Government Code.
