Although named Cilejit, the station is not located in Gintung Cilejet village, Parung Panjang, but is located to the west of the village. The station, which is located at an altitude of +53 meters, only serves the Commuter Line. This station is one of the stations on the Merak-Tanah Abang railway line located in Bogor Regency in addition to Parung Panjang station and Tenjo station. The north side of the station is included in the Tangerang Regency area while the south side of the station is included in the Bogor Regency area with railroad tracks as a separator between the two regions. Only one KRL Commuter Line service stops at this station, which is the Tanah Abang-Serpong-Tigaraksa-Rangkasbitung route.   Building and layout[edit] Initially, the station had one railway line from 1906 - 1990. The original Staatsspoorwegen building is still in use today, in the 1990s the line was increased to 2 lines. Since the double track and the extension of the Commuter Line network have been tested as of May 2012, the layout of this station was changed by adding two high side platforms and changing the existing line 2 into a straight line towards Rangkasbitung. This station, since April 17, 2013, has been serving Commuter Line (KRL AC) to Tanah Abang station.[3]   R14    G  Main building   Platform floor  Side platform, the doors are opened on the right side   Line 2  ← (Daru)  Rangkasbitung Line to Tigaraksa/Rangkasbitung   Line 1   Rangkasbitung Line to Tanah Abang (Parung Panjang) →   Side platform, the doors are opened on the right side   G  Main building  Services[edit] The following is a list of train services at the Cilejit Station.
