Population[edit] Iraq-born people are the third largest minority group living in Sweden, after the Sweden Finns (5.1%) and the Syrians (2.4%).[4][5] They are also one of the largest Asian communities in Sweden.[3] Sweden also has Europe's largest community of Iraqi Mandaeans.[6]  Migration history[edit] Iraqi immigrants to Sweden have come in four distinct waves of migration. In the first wave (1968–1978), around 8,000 Kurdish and Assyrian nationalists and Iraqi communists were escaping the Baathist regime. The second wave (1980–1988) of 10,000 people was mainly Kurds and Assyrians escaping the Al-Anfal Campaign and Iraqi men escaping forced conscription in the Iran–Iraq War. The third wave (1991–1999) was about 15,000 people, again mostly Kurdish and Assyrian people from Northern Iraq; most came with families. The largest numbers, almost 30,000 people, of Iraqis in Sweden today have migrated as a consequence of the Iraq War of 2003 to 2010; most are Sunni Arabs and Assyrian Christians. Christian Iraqis, fearing persecution in their homeland, made up a large part of that influx after Iraq occupation in 2003.[5] Sweden accepted more than half of all asylum applications from Iraqis in Europe. In 2006, over 9,000 Iraqis fled their country and came to Sweden seeking shelter, a fourfold increase over 2005.[7] In 2007, Sweden attempted to throttle the influx of Iraqi refugees by tightening the rules for asylum seekers,[5] but in 2008 there were again record numbers of Iraqi immigrants, close to 12,000. In 2009, the number of immigrants fell again slightly, to 8,400.

In 2005 only 0.1 percent of Iraqis were recognised as refugees, but the total recognition rate including those granted complementary protection was a relatively high 24 per cent. In the year 2006 however, recognition rates leapt to a total of 91 per cent.[1] The Swedish Migration Board decided in early 2006 that all Iraqi asylum-seekers from Central and Southern Iraq whose claims had been rejected as part of the normal status determination process would nevertheless receive a permanent residence permit, allowing the majority of Iraqis in Sweden to begin the process of fully[citation needed] integrating into Swedish society with a secure legal status. In the context of the generally low recognition rates for Iraqis in other EU states,[citation needed] Sweden's generosity led to a surge in the number of applications received from Iraqis. Figures increased from 2,330 in 2005 to 8,951 the following year, with a further 1,500 new arrivals per month in the first half of 2007. Most of these persons have joined the existing Iraqi community in Sweden in municipalities such as Malmö and Södertälje, with the scale of the influx to these areas forcing newcomers to live in very poor conditions. Speaking in June 2007, Södertälje's mayor Anders Lago described the situation as being close to breaking point, with the authorities barely able to provide basic services and many newcomers sharing apartments with up to fifteen people.[1]  Notable people[edit] Aimar Sher, footballer Darin, singer Elaf Ali, journalist and author Peter Gwargis, footballer Mohanad Jeahze, footballer Kevin Yakob, footballer Bovar Karim, footballer Ahmed Yasin, footballer Mohamed Said, actor Salam Karam, journalist Modhir Ahmed, visual artist Abir Al-Sahlani, politician Hayv Kahraman, artist and painter See also[edit]  Iraq portalSweden portal Demographics of Sweden Asian immigrants to Sweden Arabs in Sweden Islam in Sweden Kurds in Sweden Immigration to Sweden Iraqi refugees Assyrians/Syriacs in Sweden Mandaeans in Sweden List of Iraqis Iraq–Sweden relations Iraqis in Finland References[edit]   ^ a b c "Iraqis in Europe" (PDF). unhcr.org.
