The population was 21 at the time of the 2020 census, down from 27 residents at the 2010 census. [4]   Geography[edit] Located in western Lincoln County, Fallis is situated on a paved county road five miles northwest of Wellston.[5][6] According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 0.3 square miles (0.78 km2), all land.  History[edit] Fallis was founded in 1892, just south of an Indian village on the western edge of the Iowa Reservation,[6] in a wooded area and "on a long red hill."[7] Originally known as Mission, it was renamed in 1894 for its prime developer and first postmaster, Judge William Henry Fallis. Although the town is mostly abandoned today, and is nearly a ghost town, during the early 1900s Fallis was a whistle-stop for several railroad lines, and was a thriving little community with stores, hotels, banks, lumber yards, and other businesses, as well as a city hall.  The population may have reached 400 during this time.  Fallis was the home of several accomplished authors and poets.[6][7] After the Great Depression, the Dust Bowl, and the decline of the railroad, by 1950 the population had fallen to just 105 residents,[6] and much of the town was destroyed by fire in 1960.  Very little of the old town was ever rebuilt, and only a handful of buildings remain.[6][8] However, Fallis still maintains a volunteer firestation, and a community center was built in 1999.[6]  Demographics[edit]   Historical population CensusPop.Note%± 1910248—1920239−3.6%1930173−27.6%1940137−20.8%1950105−23.4%196042−60.0%197039−7.1%198022−43.6%199049122.7%200028−42.9%201027−3.6%202021−22.2%U.S. Decennial Census[9]  As of the census[3] of 2000, there were 28 people, 13 households, and 7 families residing in the town.
