She was an old woman with supernatural powers who lived in Takayama. She used a prayer to stop the eruption of a mountain after it had been rumbling for seven days, and turned the hot water of an onsen cold by throwing a horse's hoof into it.[citation needed]  References[edit] Arikura-no-baba, Kaii-Yōkai Denshō Database This article relating to Japanese mythology is a stub.
