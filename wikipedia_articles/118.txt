Publication history[edit] Great White Shark first appeared in Arkham Asylum: Living Hell #1 (July 2003) and was created by Dan Slott and Ryan Sook.[1]  Fictional character biography[edit] Warren White is a financier and embezzler who is known as the "Great White Shark" for his ruthlessness. He avoids imprisonment by pleading insanity and is imprisoned in Arkham Asylum. During a prison riot, Jane Doe locks White in Mr. Freeze's cell. He develops severe frostbite and loses his hair, nose, ears, and several fingers. Subsequently, he is driven insane and files his teeth into points.[2] White next appears in Batman: Face the Face, where he becomes Gotham's reigning crime boss following Batman and Robin's disappearance. He seeks revenge against Harvey Dent, who previously abandoned him and has since reformed. To this end, White kills Orca, KGBeast, Magpie, and Ventriloquist and frames Dent for the murders, driving him insane and leading him to return to villainy.[3][4][5][6][7] After Batman's death in Batman R.I.P., White is transferred out of Arkham and into a more secure prison.[8] In The New 52 continuity reboot, White is an ally of Black Mask and the Penguin.[9][10][11]  Powers and abilities[edit] The Great White Shark has no superpowers but is a skilled organizer and negotiator with a high-level intellect. After being deformed, he files his teeth to the point of being razor sharp.  In other media[edit] A biography of the Great White Shark, as well as a jar containing some of his body parts, appears in the Batman: Arkham series.  References[edit]  ^ Greenberger, Robert (2008).
