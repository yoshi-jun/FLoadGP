The USA, supported by the international community, made its support of the ruling family during the Gulf War conditional on the restoration of democracy, which was agreed to by the Emir in the Jeddah conference of October 1990.[2]  Electoral system[edit] Voting rights were restricted to men who could provide proof of that their ancestors were residing in Kuwait in 1920,. This resulted the number of eligible voters to 14% of the citizenry.[2]  Results[edit] PartyVotes%SeatsIndependents20Pro-government candidates18Sunni candidates7Shi'ite candidates3Secular opposition2Total50Total votes67,724–Registered voters/turnout81,44083.16Source: Nohlen et al.
