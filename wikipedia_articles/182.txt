Professional Baseball Spirits), also known as Pro Baseball Spirits[1] or just Pro Spirits (プロスピ, Puro Spi)[2][3][4] is a Japanese baseball sports simulation game series, developed by Baseball Contents Production and published by Konami. It is a spin-off series of the Jikkyō Powerful Pro Yakyū (Power Pros) franchise. While the main series Power Pros focuses on fast-paced but deep gameplay, the gameplay of Professional Baseball Spirits has a focus for realistic graphics and physics, similar to the Pro Evolution Soccer series. Just like Power Pros, most games in the series are developed under license from the Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB) and the Japan Professional Baseball Players Association (JPBPA), letting them use the league's team names, stadiums, colors, and players' names and likenesses. Also, a version of Professional Baseball Spirits featuring Major League Baseball players was released under the title eBaseball: MLB PRO SPIRIT on October 23, 2024.

Gameplay overview[edit] The game features all 12 Nippon Professional Baseball teams, and both the Pacific League and Central League All-Star teams (circa 2006, but with changes made for traded and/or retired players). The difficulty level for the game is adjustable. The easiest mode will appeal to younger players who have probably never played a baseball game before in their lives, and the hardest mode—known as Spirits Mode—will give even the most experienced and advanced players a challenge with superior AI. Other modes can be selected in a sort of pseudo-gameplay sliders mode. For instance, gameplay speed can be increased, as well as pitch speed (which can be set to "real" speed). The basic batting interface is a silhouette of a bat which influences how the ball will travel. Depending on when and where contact was made, that influences where the ball goes. The pitching is a 2-click system where the player selects his pitch around a grid, presses X to start his delivery, then pressing X as one circle converges on another to try and perfectly time the pitch.  Reception[edit] Around the time of its release, it was the only PlayStation 3 video game that was among the top 50 best-selling video games in Japan.[9]  Pro Yakyū Spirits 5[edit] 2008 video gameProfessional Baseball Spirits 5  Pro Yakyū Spirits 5Platform(s)PlayStation 3, PlayStation 2[11]ReleaseJP: April 1, 2008[10]Genre(s)SportsMode(s)Single-player, multiplayer Professional Baseball Spirits 5 (プロ野球スピリッツ5, Pro Yakyū Spirits 5) is a baseball video game published by Konami for the PlayStation 2 and PlayStation 3 in Japan on May 1, 2008.[7] It is the sequel to Professional Baseball Spirits 4.  Improvements and additions[edit] On the PlayStation 3 version of Pro Yakyū Spirits 5, the game saw many small improvements. The graphics were enhanced further from the previous incarnation, but the major fixes were in the gameplay. The load times that plagued the previous game were fixed, meaning less of the "black screens" that were used for short load times in PYS4. The game also has more of a television-style presentation, new animations for slap hits, and a new meter that tells players what pitch the CPU batter is expecting. The new mode in PYS5 which replaces the MVP Mode in the previous game is Stardom Mode. It plays like a full-fledged Career Mode, where a player can either take control of an existing player or create their own player to go through a maximum of 20 years of play. Experience points are distributed on how well the player does in his at-bat.  Pro Yakyū Spirits 5 Kanzenban[edit] An updated version of the game with the subtitle Kanzenban, which means Perfect Version, was released in December 2008. Released on both the PlayStation 2 and PlayStation 3, Kanzenban touted many improvements over the original as a post-season version of the game. For instance, every player who appeared in a game in the 2008 NPB season for all 12 teams was included on each team's roster, there were new player animations, enhanced artificial intelligence, and also small improvements to graphics (foreign players, for example, no longer look generic and have their actual swings), online play, baserunning, and fielding. Kanzenban marked the first time since Pro Yakyu Spirits 2004 Climax that a PYS game had been re-made for a post-season version, similar to that of the "Ketteiban" games in Pro Yakyu Spirits sister series, Jikkyou Powerful Pro Yakyuu.

Upon booting the game, the first menu is to decide whether the player wants to play the WBC mode or the regular Pro Yakyuu Spirits game. The rosters are accurate for all WBC teams, and is possible to play an entire tournament as any of the 16 teams.
