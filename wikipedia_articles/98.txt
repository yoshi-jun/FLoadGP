Season 1 and 2's episodes were released twice a month.[2][3] Instead of remaking the 1990s anime series preceding it, Toei Animation produced Crystal as a reboot of Sailor Moon and as a more faithful adaptation of the original manga by omitting much of the original material from the first series.[4][5][6] The story focuses on Usagi Tsukino, who is a young girl that obtains the power to become the titular character. Other Sailor Guardians join her in the search for Princess Serenity and the Silver Crystal.[7] The first episode had an advanced screening on June 30, 2014.[8][9] In May 2014, Viz Media licensed Crystal for an English-language release in North America, simulcasting the series on Neon Alley and Hulu to coincide with the worldwide streaming.[10][11][12] Crunchyroll also simulcast the series in a separate contract with Toei Animation.[13] Viz premiered the first episode as part of their "Sailor Moon Day" celebration at the Anime Expo Convention in Los Angeles.[14] The third season, based on the Infinity arc of the manga, premiered on April 4, 2016, and concluded on June 27, 2016.[15] A sequel two-part film, Pretty Guardian Sailor Moon Eternal The Movie, based on the Dream arc of the manga, was released in 2021, with the first film released on January 8 and the second on February 11,[16] followed by another sequel two-part film, Pretty Guardian Sailor Moon Cosmos The Movie, based on the Stars arc of the manga, which was released on June 9 and 30, 2023.[17]   Plot[edit] Main article: List of Sailor Moon characters Dark Kingdom[edit] Usagi Tsukino, a fourteen-year-old middle school student, meets Luna, a talking black cat that tells her that she is Sailor Moon, a Sailor Guardian destined to fight a group of villains called the Dark Kingdom. Luna also instructs Sailor Moon to find her four fellow Sailor Guardians, the long-lost Princess of an ancestral kingdom on the Moon, and a legendary artifact of supreme power known as the Silver Crystal. On her journey, Sailor Moon meets her fellow Guardians Sailor Mercury (Ami Mizuno), Sailor Mars (Rei Hino), Sailor Jupiter (Makoto Kino), Sailor Venus (Minako Aino), and a mysterious masked man called Tuxedo Mask (Mamoru Chiba), to whom Usagi is attracted. Later, Usagi and the Sailor Guardians discover that in their previous lives they were members of an ancient Moon Kingdom in a period of time called the Silver Millennium. The Dark Kingdom waged war against them, resulting in the destruction of the Moon Kingdom. It turns out that Sailor Moon herself is Princess Serenity, the Princess of the Moon Kingdom, and that she alone has the power to make the Silver Crystal appear and to use its incredible mystical powers to overcome the forces of evil.  Meanwhile, Tuxedo Mask is revealed to be Prince Endymion, the first crown prince of the Earth and Serenity's lover in his previous life. After defeating the Four Kings of Heaven (who turn out to have been Prince Endymion's loyal knights in the past) and killing their leader Queen Beryl, the Sailor Guardians confront a brainwashed Endymion and the ruler of the Dark Kingdom — Queen Metaria. To prevent Queen Metaria from spreading darkness all over the Earth, the Guardians sacrifice their lives. Using the power of the Silver Crystal, Sailor Moon destroys Queen Metaria and reunites with her four friends upon returning them to life.  Black Moon[edit] After Sailor Moon restores the Earth to normal and prepares to live a normal life again with Mamoru and her friends, a little girl falls from the sky, claiming to have the same name as Usagi, but nicknamed as "Chibiusa" by Usagi and the others. A group of villains called the Black Moon Clan, led by Prince Demande, initiate a series of operations which lead to the abductions of Sailors Mars, Mercury, and Jupiter while looking for Chibiusa and the Silver Crystal. Chibiusa is revealed to be Sailor Moon's and Tuxedo Mask's daughter from a distant future that has been decimated by the Clan, and is searching for Sailor Moon and the Silver Crystal in order to save her mother. Sailor Moon and her friends accompany Chibiusa to the future, and they meet the Guardian of Time and Chibiusa's friend, Sailor Pluto the Sailor Guardian of Spacetime. After being captured herself, Sailor Moon then rescues Mars, Mercury, and Jupiter and together they manage to escape from the Black Moon Clan's headquarters, the planet Nemesis but Chibiusa is manipulated by Prince Demande's advisor and the true mastermind of the Clan, Death Phantom, and transforms into Black Lady who also later brainwashes Tuxedo Mask as well. During an intense battle Demande manages to obtain the Silver Crystals of the past and the future and is about to bring them together when Sailor Pluto stops time to prevent the universe from being destroyed by this act, leading to her own death. Black Lady is shocked to see her friend die and reverts to her true self, transforming into Sailor Chibi Moon. While Demande dies protecting Sailor Moon from Death Phantom, the latter is destroyed by the combined powers of Sailor Moon and the awakened Sailor Chibi Moon. Neo-Queen Serenity who had also awakened then gives the four Sailor Guardians new Planet Powers and gives Sailor Moon a new brooch as well (as her old one was destroyed defeating Death Phantom), Sailor Moon and her friends say goodbye to their future selves and return to the past and everything returns to normal. Chibiusa also returns to the future afterwards but returns shortly afterwards to stay in the past and train as a Sailor Guardian.  Death Busters[edit] After students from the prestigious Mugen Academy become victims of a group of villains called the Death Busters, who transform them into Daimons, Usagi and their friends meet two Mugen Academy students: tomboyish car racer Haruka Tenoh and violinist prodigy Michiru Kaioh. Haruka and Michiru are the civilian identities of two new Sailor Guardians: Sailor Uranus and Sailor Neptune, who are initially reluctant to work with Sailor Moon and the others. Chibiusa befriends a mysterious girl named Hotaru Tomoe, daughter of Mugen Academy founder Professor Tomoe, who is later revealed to be a key figure of the Death Busters. Sailor Pluto is reborn as university student Setsuna Meioh, and she joins Sailors Uranus and Sailor Neptune. Using the power of all nine Sailor Guardians, Usagi evolves into Super Sailor Moon. The Sailor Guardians learn that Hotaru's body is host to Mistress 9, partner of the leader of the Death Busters, Master Pharaoh 90. At the same time, Hotaru is also the lookalike reincarnation of the Sailor Guardian of Silence and Destruction, Sailor Saturn, who has the power to destroy the whole world. For this reason, Sailors Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto fear. In the climactic battle, Pharaoh 90 begins to merge himself with the planet, but the newly awakened Sailor Saturn uses her full power to send him back to his dimension, the Tau Star System, sacrificing herself in the process. As Neo-Queen Serenity, Usagi restores the city and resurrects everyone that was killed in the final battle, including Hotaru, who is immediately reborn as an infant alongside Saturn's spirit within her once again. Haruka, Michiru, and Setsuna vow to be Hotaru's family and leave the city, with the promise to rejoin Usagi and her friends someday.

The first limited edition Blu-ray was released on June 29, 2016.[54]  Soundtrack[edit] See also: List of Sailor Moon soundtracks Yasuharu Takanashi composed the score for Sailor Moon Crystal. The series uses two pieces of theme music for the first two seasons. The opening theme song is "Moon Pride" and the ending theme song is "Gekkō" (月虹, lit. "Moonbow"); both themes were performed by Momoiro Clover Z. The ending theme's music was written by Naoko Takeuchi (under the name of "Sumire Shirobara"), and composed by Akiko Kosaka, who has written several songs for the Sailor Moon series.[55][56] The character song album, titled Pretty Guardian Sailor Moon Crystal Character Song Collection: Crystal Collection, was released on April 29, 2015.[57] For the third season, four pieces of theme music are used: one opening theme and three ending themes. The opening theme song, "New Moon ni Koishite" (ニュームーンに恋して, Nyū Mūn ni Koishite, lit. "In Love With The New Moon") has three different versions. The first version is performed by Etsuko Yakushimaru for the first four episodes and reprised for the final episode, the second version performed by Mitsuko Horie for acts 31 to 34, and the third performed by Momoiro Clover Z for acts 35 to 38.[58] The first ending theme song is "Eternal Eternity" performed by Junko Minagawa and Sayaka Ohara, who voice Sailors Uranus and Neptune, respectively, used for acts 27 to 30 and reprised for act 39, mirroring the first version of the opening theme. The second ending theme song is "Otome no Susume" (乙女のススメ, lit. "Maiden's Advice") performed by Misato Fukuen, who is Chibiusa's voice actress, used for acts 31 to 34, mirroring the second version of the opening theme. The third and final ending theme song is "Eien Dake ga Futari wo Kakeru" (永遠だけが二人をかける, lit. "Eternity Brings Two Together") performed by Kenji Nojima, who is Mamoru Chiba's voice actor, used for acts 35 to 38, mirroring the third version of the opening theme.[33]  Reception[edit] The first episode of Sailor Moon Crystal earned a viewership of over one million on Niconico during the first two days of streaming it.[59]  Critical response[edit] The first two seasons of Sailor Moon Crystal were criticized for its overly fast pacing and its animation, which had noticeable errors. Victoria McNally of The Mary Sue wrote: "I can overlook poor quality animation when it's not too distracting. The problem with Sailor Moon Crystal is that it is getting distracting, because the series also has issues with the pacing and quality of its storytelling—which gives you a lot of downtime to criticize all of its visual flaws."[60] The third season however, was praised for its improved animation and better characterization. Michael S. Mammano of Den of Geek, who reviewed the first episode of the third season, wrote "This feels like a whole new show, and I mean that in the best way", and rated the episode 4 out of 5 stars.[61] Rebecca Silverman of Anime News Network gave the first two seasons B− ratings,[62][63] while solid B rating for the third season, as she felt that while the first two seasons are good on their own, the third season was an improvement out of all three seasons.[64]  Notes[edit]   ^ a b c Through Madman Anime.  ^ a b Full title: Pretty Guardian Sailor Moon Eternal The Movie (劇場版「美少女戦士セーラームーンEternal」, Gekijōban Bishōjo Senshi Sērā Mūn Etānaru)  ^ a b Full title: Pretty Guardian Sailor Moon Cosmos The Movie (劇場版「美少女戦士セーラームーンCosmos」, Gekijōban Bishōjo Senshi Sērā Mūn Kosumosu)   References[edit]   ^ Mohajer-Va-Pesaran, Daphne (July 3, 2013).
