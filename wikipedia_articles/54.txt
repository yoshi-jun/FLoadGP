    From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia   Armand Heine (1818 – 9 November 1883) was a Jewish banker and philanthropist born in Bordeaux, France, who later lived in his chateau and vineyard, Beychevelle in Bordeaux.[1] With his brother Michel he founded the famous bank Armand & Michel Heine, in cooperation with Rothschild Frères & Co. in Paris, France, and New Orleans, Louisiana, United States. Armand was married to Marie-Amélie Kohn, daughter of a famous, very rich Jewish family, born in Bohemia.[2] Armand Heine died in 1883 at Beychevelle, leaving 22000 francs in his will for the funding of housing for the poor of Paris.[3] You could read in the Paris newspapers of the time:    "Thanks to the generosity of the philanthropical society of the family of Michel and Armand Heine a whole series of new homes was built in Rue Jeanne d'Arc and Boulevard de Grenelle."[citation needed]   References[edit]   ^ Bertall, Charles Albert d'Arnould (2005).
