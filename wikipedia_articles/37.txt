Its population was 159 in 2016.[1] Jörgen is known for its fine white wines.  Next to the more common white wines, it also produces Uhudler wines in small quantities. Uhudler is a unique wine from Austria, which originates in the Burgenland region. In Jörgen the white version may often be found, whereas is in Burgenland, its appearance is often a rosé colour. It has intense flavours of strawberry and black currants, a characteristic taste often called "foxy" in wine parlance. The grape varieties used are highly resistant to phylloxera and other diseases; as a result they do not often have to be sprayed with pesticides. They also require little fertilization because of their vigorous growth.  References[edit]   ^ a b "Statistik Austria, Bevölkerung am 1.1.2016 nach Ortschaften".
