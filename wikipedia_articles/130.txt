The site was designated a Prefectural Historic Site in 1971, with the area under protection extended in 2007.[1]   Overview[edit] The site was discovered during agricultural work in 1968, with the stone circle identified during the second phase of survey and excavation.[1] The site is understood to have changed in function over time, from a Middle Jōmon settlement, through a Late Jōmon burial site, with some thirty graves, to a worship site centred on the stone circle.[1][2][3] The last measures some 7 metres (23 ft) north to south by 9 metres (30 ft) east to west;[1] it has since been reburied and is presented through a reconstruction.[1][2]  See also[edit] List of Historic Sites of Japan (Tokyo) Kōgasaka Stone Age Site References[edit]   ^ a b c d e f 町田市田端環状積石遺構 [Relics of Stone Circle at Tabata, Machida City] (in Japanese).
