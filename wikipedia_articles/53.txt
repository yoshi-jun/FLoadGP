The Jackson Free Library, which opened in 1903, was the first public library in Jackson. Part of the funding for its construction came from philanthropist Andrew Carnegie. After the Jackson-Madison County Library was built to replace it, the Free Library underwent a period of deterioration that ended in 1987 when the city undertook to restore it.[2] It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975.[1] The facility is now a venue for weddings and other special events. The museum in the Carnegie Center features exhibits on the Civil War.[2] The museum was also formerly known as the Discovery Museum of West Tennessee.[3]  References[edit]   ^ a b "National Register Information System".
