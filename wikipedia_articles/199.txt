The season started on 13 July and concluded on 30 September 2019 with the second leg of the finals. América de Cali won their first league title following a 3–2 win on aggregate against Independiente Medellín in the finals.[1] Atlético Huila were the defending champions, but were eliminated by the eventual runners-up Independiente Medellín in the semifinals.   Format[edit] For this season, the league featured 20 teams, which were split into five double round-robin groups of four teams. The top teams in each group as well as the three best runners-up advanced to the quarterfinals, with the winners advancing to the semifinals. The winners of each semifinal qualified for the final to decide the champions. All rounds in the knockout stage were played on a home-and-away basis.[2] The champions qualified for the 2019 Copa Libertadores Femenina, joining Atlético Huila who are already qualified as titleholders. On 15 June 2019, DIMAYOR and the FCF announced an agreement with CONMEBOL for an additional berth for Colombia into the Copa Libertadores Femenina, which was awarded to the league runners-up.[3]  Teams[edit] 20 teams took part in the competition.[2] The teams are affiliated with DIMAYOR affiliate clubs. Alianza Petrolera, Bogotá, Deportes Quindío, Envigado, Patriotas, Real Cartagena, and Unión Magdalena did not field a team in this edition, whilst Deportivo Cali, Independiente Medellín, Millonarios, and Once Caldas competed for the first time.
